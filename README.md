**Due: March 13, 2020**

### Objective

The objective for this lab is to use wireshark to examine network traffic within a trace

### Directory Structure

The directory structure used herein to manage documents and files is as follows:

At the top level, files describing the project meant for users to read: ```README.md```. The only other files that would be expected here is a ```.gitignore``` file, listing files and/or folders which Git should ignore and a ```.git``` file, containing git metadata. There is one subdirectory of this structure: ```/src```

All source code and answers related to this project is located in the ```/src``` subdirectory.
